Kubernetes presents exciting choices to improve our system architecture. 
Service meshes in particular provide a comprehensive layer that seamlessly and transparently supplies discovery, routing, circuit breaking, distributed tracing (and more!), and enables easy integration into supporting systems. 
In some cases, these new options overlap with familiar solutions, like Spring Cloud or an API management platform. 
This creates confusion. 
Do we replace our current systems? Or are they complementary? Letâ€™s explore how Istio addresses many of these needs and how our existing solutions might still fit into the picture.
