As Kubernetes becomes the runtime platform of choice, turning apps into production-grade images with confidence and ease becomes critical to achieving productivity and success. Dockerfile and Jib are popular approaches, yet they present significant challenges, especially as the number and variety of applications increases. Enter Cloud Native Buildpacks - tooling that makes it quick and easy to build and maintain images for a variety of languages, while providing security, auditability, transparency, and control.

In this talk we'll review the pros and cons of Dockerfile and Jib, and we'll cover the basics of Cloud Native Buildpacks, including a few different ways to use Buildpacks to address a variety of use cases and challenges. By the end of this talk youâ€™ll understand how you can make short work of building images in a secure, repeatable way.
