With Kubernetes, everything from deployment to monitoring to scaling is more standardized and inherently easier to automate. 
This presents the possibility to achieve a more effective and comprehensive Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) experience. 
We can incorporate the practice of infrastructure-as-code and take advantage of a flourishing ecosystem of tools to improve and fully automate our application deployment strategies. 
In this session, we’ll tour the landscape of new Kubernetes-centric tooling, including Tekton, Kustomize, and ArgoCD. 
We’ll also explore how GitOps can be leveraged for CI/CD.
